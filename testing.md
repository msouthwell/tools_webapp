# Final Testing

In preparation for the final TA presentation on Saturday 04/23/2016 from 9:00AM - 9:30AM EDT via Webex.

While testing, make sure to modify your database.json file accordingly and watch MySQL workbench to make sure the queries will be readable by the TA grader.

When testing, fill in if the test passed or failed, and the steps you took. If the test failed, file an issue on Github.

Also, before testing, drop and re-seed `handyman` db so that we are all working with the same dataset.
